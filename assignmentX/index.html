    <h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assignment X: Creating a Personality</span></h1>

<p> </p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Description:</span></h3>

<p> This assignment will ask you to tell a story through the creation of a character rather than an entire storyline.<br>
    You will explore an environment through a character's eyes instead of telling a narrative, and having the player<br>
    learn about the story and the world through the lens of the character that you create. The narrative will be produced<br>
    and created by how the character interacts and reacts to the environment that they are in.
</p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assignment Purpose</span></h3>

<p> 
    The purpose of this assignment is to explore the world of subtle storytelling where players will not be given explicit<br>
    narrative about the game, but still be able to infer things about the world and story through interactions between 
    <br>characters and the world.

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assignment Specification:</span></h3>

<p> </p>

<ol>

  <li>Create a single main character that the player controls/plays through using an engine of your choice.<br>
     Other characters may be created for the sake of interactions, but dialogue between characters should not <br>
     be the narrative itself, but it should give subtle hints towards backstory or a narrative<br>
</li>
<br>
  <li>A narrative story or backstory of your choice that is to be discovered through interactions with the<br>
    environment or other characters.
</li>
<br>
  <li>General playtime of ~5 mins, with the lore/narrative being discovered and somewhat explained by the end of the game</li>
<br>
  <li>
    Text file to be turned in with the submission explaining the story that is implied in the environment and a list of the <br>
    hints towards this story from the interactions in the game. Aim for around ~300 words.
  </li>
</ol>

  

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collaboration:</span></h3>
<p>If you choose to collaborate on this assignment, create two different characters and have them interact in the same space to<br>
discover a shared lore/story between the two. The general playtime should be ~7mins and the text file submission should cover more<br>
interactions and specific events between the two characters. </p>
